 1.Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens (Medium Risk)**
- Occurrences:19
- Description:The application is missing proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protections.
- Impact:Attackers could potentially deceive users into performing unintended actions on the authenticated web application, leading to unauthorized operations.

Missing Security Headers (Medium to Low Risk)
- Issues Identified:
  - Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set
  - Missing Anti-clickjacking Header
  - X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing
- Impact:The absence of these headers increases the application's vulnerability to various attacks, such as clickjacking and MIME type confusion.

 3. Information Disclosure (Low Risk)
- Issues Identified:
  - Server leaks information via "X-Powered-By" HTTP response header**
  - Server leaks version information via "Server" HTTP response header**
- Impact:Attackers could use this information to identify the technology stack and exploit known vulnerabilities associated with it.

4. Authentication Issues (Low Risk)
- Occurrences: 2 instances of potential weaknesses in the authentication mechanism.
- Description: The identified weaknesses could potentially be exploited, leading to unauthorized access.
- Impact: If exploited, these weaknesses could allow unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive parts of the application.

 Risk Assessment Summary
The identified vulnerabilities have been rated based on their potential impact and the likelihood of exploitation. Immediate attention should be given to "Critical" and "High" risk vulnerabilities due to their potential for significant damage. While the "Medium" and "Low" risk issues are considered lower priority, they still require remediation to ensure comprehensive security. Risk ratings should be reassessed regularly as part of an ongoing security program, considering the specific context of the application and the organization's risk tolerance.
